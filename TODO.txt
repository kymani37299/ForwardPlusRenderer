TODO:
- Only do MSAA on DepthPrepass and use results for AA on drawing
- Create new scene with thousands of objects for profiling
- Per frame data instead of 1000s of constant buffers
- Make better constant buffer system so we don't create CBs every frame
- Meshlet culling
- Create loading cache
- Add default shader defines

Bugs:
- CPU culling is not culling same things as GPU frustum culling
- SSAO not working
- TAA has visible jittering
- Validation errors on changing scenes
- Shadow edges are flickering when moving
- MTR_LOADING doesn't load first scene properly
- Changing scenes causes GPU memory leak

Notes:
- Using Release OptickCore.dll, not sure if it matters for debug build
- Using GraphicsContext in GUI::Render , is it really nesecarry ?
- Using GraphicsContext in Application::Update, is it really necesarry ?
